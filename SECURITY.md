## Reporting a Vulnerability

There aren't many attack vectors for this project aside from malicious images but if you find a security vulnerability with png-chunks, please [send me an email](mailto:michaellrowley@protonmail.com) or open an issue (both contact methods should have similar patch times) so that I can get the issue patched/fixed as soon as possible.
